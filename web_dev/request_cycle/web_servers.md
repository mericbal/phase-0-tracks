Q2 - To my understanding , Linux only runs with command line , it gives users complete control ..

Q3 - VPS allows us to create an imaginary computer that we can reach mobile from everywhere ..
    We can store data in this server ..
    Advantages are that only we can reach it if we do not open it for all internet world ..

Q4 - Root is a special user for Linux ..
    So it is better to create a user and work on that profile ..
    Better for security ..
