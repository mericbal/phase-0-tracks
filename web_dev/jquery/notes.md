I am thinking about using w3schools.com

As i can see they have a nice setup to show you what each code does ..

Honestly , i am writing this after the i have done the project because i forgot this note file .. :)

I had two 10 mins breaks in 2 hours .. Which is nice , and enough to keep me going .. :)

I prefer to use my past file to work on and made some changes on it ..


Now time is up and i really enjoyed using jQuery ..
